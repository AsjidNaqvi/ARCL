            How Speech Therapy Works
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 font-nunito leading-relaxed">
            Speech therapy involves one-on-one sessions with a licensed
            speech-language pathologist (SLP). The therapist will assess the
            studentâ€™s speech and language abilities, identify specific
            challenges, and develop a personalized treatment plan. Sessions may
            include articulation exercises, language games, and strategies for
            fluency and social communication.

            When Should a Student Receive Speech Therapy?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 font-nunito leading-relaxed">
            Students who have difficulty speaking clearly, understanding
            language, or using language in social situations may benefit from
            speech therapy. It can also be helpful for students with speech
            disorders such as stuttering or voice issues.
